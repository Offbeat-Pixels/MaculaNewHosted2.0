            we assist you to expand your product to different markets and
            geographies by being your virtual sales support. We understand that
            on one hand where Marketing is relatively easy to come by, it is the
            sales process that invariably becomes a bottle-neck in successful
            closure of clients, over that the increased competition in the
            market mandates a pointed sales effort that is well targeted and
            executed by a well experienced sales team. The team at Macula
            Consultants have several decades of collective sales experience that
            cuts across products, sectors & geographies, competent enough to
